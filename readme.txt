This is the current prototyping I have done for the Overworld. 
This has a snowball throwing mechanic, which can destroy some tiles on the map. More can be integrated with it later.
I also implemented the ability to import maps from the Tiled editor, so when we make a map for this game, it will be a lot easier, I just need art for it.
The enemy AI is very basic until we can do more production, as is the npc talking mechanic.

Current Controls:
WASD: Movement
Arrow Keys: Throw snowball
SPACE: Talk to npc (black boxes)
ESCAPE: Exit textbox
